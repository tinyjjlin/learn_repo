1. 首先找到host文件：C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
```# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
172.18.19.3     guest.os.beiruosi.wang
172.18.19.3     staff.os.beiruosi.wang
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost

```
